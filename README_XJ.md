TIC TAC TOE (gameXXXproject-client)

Created using HTMl, CSS, Javascript, jquery AJAX, and json.  

My process involved referencing WDI course materials, reviewing online resources such as w3schools.com, reviewing the game project issue queue, collaborating with other students, and asking for help from instructors. 

My greatest struggles centered around game logic, and figuring out how all of the files were interacting.  

User stories:

A user should be able to sign-up/create account with email and password.
A user should be able to sign-in with that account each time they play.
A user should be able to start game with an empty game board
A user should be able to select squares and alternate between X and O. 
A user should be able to replay game with an empty game board
A user should be able to see the number of games played. 
A user should be able to change password.
